            <h4>
                Espresso is a coffee-brewing method, in which a small amount of nearly boiling water is forced under 9–10 bars of pressure through finely-ground coffee beans.
                <p></p>
                <div class="quotes">
                    The taste of espresso should have a sweet tone and resemble rich caramel. The perfect flavor is the result of carefully measured variables such as grind size, extraction time, and water temperature. Espresso should never taste sour. Any bitter flavor is the result of under-extraction.

                    A doppio tastes precisely like an espresso, with a concentrated coffee taste and aroma. A well-extracted doppio will have a palate balanced between sweet, acidic, and bitter. The individual flavor notes will depend on the espresso beans used and can be anything from sweet and fruity to earthy and nutty.

                <div class="quotes">
                    These coffee drinks taste essentially like the espresso they're made with. If the espresso is the lemony varietal, that’s what your Americano will taste like. Espresso flavors range from earthy and robust to citrusy and sour. It’s more mild than espresso since it’s watered down and even a bit more mild than regular coffee.

                    Latte Macchiato tastes like coffee with a lot of milk. But that just makes it creamy and pleasantly thick. The coffee taste is strong due to the espresso.

                    The caramel macchiato, tastes like lattee macchiato, but it's sweet. The strong espresso and milk make the beverage taste creamy and pleasant. You can always reduce the sweetness by adding less caramel and vanilla syrup.
